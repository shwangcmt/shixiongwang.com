Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

Guides lead a user *through a specific task* they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

### A test sub-section

let's see if this works. Let me incert a math formula: $E=mc^2$ and a display math formula:
$$
E=mc^2
$$
And a schodinger's equation:
$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \frac{\hbar}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}
$$

## Omit the unnecessary
In how-to guides, **practical usability is more helpful than completeness**. Whereas a tutorial needs to be a complete, end-to-end guide, a how-to guide does not. It should start and end in some reasonable, meaningful place, and require the reader to join it up to their own work.

## Provide a set of instructions
A how-to guide describes an *executable solution* to a real-world problem or task. It’s in the form of a contract: if you’re facing this situation, then you can work your way through it by taking the steps outlined in this approach. The steps are in the form of actions.
